## Overview

The GNT series of games currently has a very active modding community. Most modding work is currently going into the Super GNT4 mod. Here you can find the [SUPER Naruto Gekitou Ninja Taisen 4 Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBm2x1XauN8). And by going to the [Super GNT4 Discord](https://discord.gg/wyNpXKx) you can download the mod.

## Skins

For those only interested in modifying textures or installing custom skins for an emulated copy of the GNT games you are in luck. The [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) drastically simplifies this process with the **Dump Textures** and **Load Textures** tools. This will allow you to skip straight to the texture design process.

You can find a guide for loading textures/skins here: [Dolphin Texture Loading](/general/docs/guides/dolphin_texture_loading.md)

You can find a list of community made skins and textures here: [Skins](/gnt4/docs/guides/skins.md)

You can find a set of textures for the game to translate it mostly into English here:

## Additional Modding

If you are wanting to do any modding beyond skins, it will require some more effort.

One way is by using Gecko codes. Gecko codes are similar to [GameShark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameShark) or [Action Replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_Replay) codes. They allow you to modify code in the game, inject new code, modify memory while the game is running, and much more. You can find the full Gecko code type documentation under [Gecko Code Type Documentation](/general/docs/guides/gecko_codetype_documentation.md).

Another valuable tool for modding GNT games is [GNTool](https://github.com/NicholasMoser/GNTool). It provides tools for interacting with GNT related files, as well as create workspaces for modding GNT4. Many options are included for easily modding the game. The changes can quickly be tested in Dolphin and even repacked in a new ISO.

Decompilation of GNT4 is currently underway at [doldecomp/gnt4](https://github.com/doldecomp/gnt4). You can also use Ghidra to reverse engineer the code of the game yourself. It is recommended to follow the [Ghidra Guide](/gnt4/docs/guides/ghidra.md) to do so.
