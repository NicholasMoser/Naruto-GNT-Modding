# Character Struct

Holds values related to a player character in battle. Named `chr_p` in the decompilation. They appear to have a size of `0xA08` bytes (per `memset` at address 0x800560d4)

## Where to Find

The absolute positions of these structs can be found at the locations listed below. Additional locations can be found in `chr_init_dummy_team`, `chr_init_player`, `chr_init_static`, or `chr_init_team` after the call to `TRK_memset`.

- Player 1: `80226358`
- Player 2: `80226614`
- Player 3: `802268D0`
- Player 4: `80226B8C`
- CPU 1: `802283F8`
- CPU 2: `802283FC`
  - This also serves as the address for P2 in training mode
- CPU 3: `80228400`
- CPU 4: `80228404`

The addresses `80228408` and `8022840c` also appear to be used for 3v3 Training Mode.

- Partner Character 1: `80228424`
- Partner Character 2: `80228420`
- Partner Character 3: `8022841C`
- Partner Character 4: `80228418`
- Partner Character 5: `80228414`
- Partner Character 6: `80228410`
  - i.e. Naruto and Itachi clones, Tayuya doki demon, Kankuro's puppet, and Kiba's dog. Anything non-playable character with a char struct.
    You can have up to 6 by doing a 3v3 battle where each character has a Partner Character. The order doesn't correlate to the player number,
    but rather is added as Partner Characters are needed. In a 1v1 match where P2 has a Partner Character, their Partner Character will be
    Partner Character 1.

## Values

### 0x00: **Flags**

- 00000001: If set to 0, the character is removed. Probably used to remove clones and such.

### 0x14: **Player ID 2**

The "controller" of the player, e.g. 0x0 through 0x3.

### 0x18: **Player ID 3**

The "controller" of the player, e.g. 0x0 through 0x3.

### 0x1c: **Character ID**

  - See [INTERNAL_CHAR_ORDER](https://github.com/NicholasMoser/GNTool/blob/3.7/src/main/java/com/github/nicholasmoser/gnt4/GNT4Characters.java#L105)

### 0x20: **Costume ID**

  - The costume selected for the character.
    - 1st (A): 0
    - 2nd (Y): 1
    - 3rd (X): 2
    - 4th (Z): 3

### 0x24: **Transform Model Flag**

A flag to set if the character model is to be transformed in some way. One example is to set it to 1 when Choji enlarges during certain attacks. It is also apparently used by Akamaru for something. Used by opcode `2108`.

### 0x30: **Health Multipler**

A multipler for calculating health. For example, Naruto has 0xDC total health and a health multiplier of 0x64. After some calculations around instruction 0x8003f674,
this results in a total health of 0xDC. But, when using the character modifier flag of "Health Boost Lv2", the health multiplier will instead be 0xC8. This will
result in a total health of 0x1B8.

### 0x38: **Own SEQ struct**

  - Contains information about the SEQ, starting offset found at offset 0x5C from the address stored in offset 0x1C

### 0x3C: **Opponent SEQ struct**

  - Contains information about the SEQ, starting offset found at offset 0x5C from the address stored in offset 0x1C

### 0x40: **Opponent chr_p**

Seems to be an opponent chr_p pointer. Referenced at dol address 0x800c02c8.

### 0x44 **Some Seq Pointer**

Seems to be some pointer to an offset in an seq file, probably 0010.seq. Referenced at dol address 0x800c3ab8.

### 0x48

[Set here](https://nicholasmoser.github.io/iru_0000.html#15390)
  
### 0x110: **Movement Stuff**

Pointer to some movement related stuff.

### 0x114: **Animation Stuff**

Pointer to animation related stuff. Offset 0x1c contains the current gnta data being executed by the chr.

### 0x118: **Knockback Function Curve 1**

The first function curve value for the animation of being knocked back by a hit.

### 0x11c: **Knockback Function Curve 2**

The second function curve value for the animation of being knocked back by a hit.

### 0x120: **Knockback Speed**

How long the knockback animation takes as a float. Lower is slower. Derived from the above two function curve values.
