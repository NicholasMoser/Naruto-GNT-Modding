# Opcode Group 37

Most of these opcodes operate on texture IDs. Here's an example of some used in battle, identified by changing
their y coordinates.

Note that the health bar is not tied to 0x2A, but instead appears to be tied to 0x3.

## 3700 - texture_init

Init a texture. First operand is the ID.

## 3701

## 3702

## 3703

## 3704 - texture_set_xy

Set a texture's x and y coordinate on the screen.

## 3705 - texture_set_x

Set a texture's x coordinate on the screen.

## 3706 - texture_set_y

Set a texture's y coordinate on the screen.

## 3707

## 3708 - texture_move_to_texture

Does some weird movement with textures, possibly centering it on the location of another texture?

## 3709 - texture_reset

Reset a texture.

## 370A

## 370B

## 370C - texture_set_flip

Sets whether to flip the texture. Flip the texture by setting value to 1.

## 370D

## 370E - texture_multi_reset

Reset multiple textures at once.

## 370F - texture_nop

No-op.

## 3710

## 3711

## 3712

## 3713

## 3714

## 3715

## 3716 - texture_andc_flip

Sets whether to flip the texture. Does so by calculating `andc` (AND with Complement) from the given input on the current value.
This is equivalent to `current = current & ~input`. I think it's primarily used to disable flipping, whether it is enabled or not.
