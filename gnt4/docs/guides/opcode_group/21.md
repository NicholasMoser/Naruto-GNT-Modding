## 2100 - check_new_action

Checks to see if the character action changed this frame, and if so performs some action related logic.

Stores 0 (if no action change) or 1 (if the action has changed) in `gpr19` and `cr`.

## 2104 - create_hitbox

`21 04 00 26` is hitbox locations on bones. The hitbox will be placed on (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) of the bone, so the very center of it.

`21 04 00 26 00 0D 00 99 00 00 00 00` for example: `0D` is the bone and `99` is the size.

The size is a short from 0x0 to 0xFFFF and is converted to a float. 0x0 is convert to 0.0 and 0xFFFF is converted to 1279.98, therefore we can conclude the short represents a step from 0.0 to 1280.0.

Example:

|Short (hex) |Float   |
|------------|--------|
|0           | 0.0    |
|10          | 0.3125 |
|20          | 0.625  |
|30          | 0.9375 |
|40          | 1.25   |
|50          | 1.5625 |
|60          | 1.875  |
|70          | 2.1875 |
|80          | 2.5    |
|90          | 2.8125 |
|98          | 2.96875|
|99          | 2.98828|
|A0          | 3.125  |
|B0          | 3.4375 |
|C0          | 3.75   |
|D0          | 4.0625 |
|F0          | 4.6875 |
|FF          | 4.98047|
|100         | 5.0    |
|200         | 10.0   |
|400         | 20.0   |
|800         | 40.0   |
|1000        | 80.0   |
|8000        | 640.0  |
|FFFF        | 1279.98|

 
## 2105 - set_pow_dmg_grd

Set a character's attack POW, DMG, and GRD.

`21 05 00 26 00 0D 00 14 00 0D 00 00` for example: The first `0D` is POW which is the damage the move does, `14` is the DMG which is stun on a grounded hit. This is combined with the W, M, or S in KF flags.
The second `0D` is GRD which is the guard damage the attack does, but the guard stun is determined by W, M, or S in KF flags and is a flat rate
 
## 2106 - set_ang_dir

Set a character's attack ANG and DIR.

`21 06 00 26 40 00 E0 00` for example: `40 00` is the ANG, which is the float value on the move when hitting an airborne opponent, `E0 00` is the DIR which is the direction the move sends the opponent in

For DIR: Subtract from `10000` to find the opposite
Examples:
`E000` and `2000` are opposites
`CC00` and `3400` are opposites
 
21 07 00 26 is hitbox appearance and disappearance frames:
21 07 00 26 00 0E 00 11
0E is the frame the hitbox first appears and 11 is the frame the hitbox disappears.

## 2107 - set_hitbox_timer

Sets the timer for character attack hitbox appearance.

Example: `21 07 01 26 00 1D 00 1E`. The third byte (`0x01` in this example) is responsible for:

- Set `chr_p->sync_timer_after_hitbox = 0` (start of action) when the third byte is 0
- Set `chr_p->sync_timer_after_hitbox = -1` (neutral) when the third byte is anything else

`0x001D` in the above example is the `chr_p->hitbox_appearance_timer` and `0x001E` is the `chr_p->hitbox_removal_timer`.

## 2108 - transform_chr_model

Accesses the chr_p flag `Transform Model Flag` to do stuff. One example is to set it to 1 when Choji enlarges during certain attacks. It is also apparently used by Akamaru for something.

## 2109

## 210A

## 210B - rev2_knockback_modify

If REV2 on the given chr_p is 0 or greater, does some weird stuff to knockback from hits. When I set REV2 to 1 characters immediately recover from knockback for instance.

## 210C - set_rev_and_rev2

Sets both the REV and REV2 value on a chr_p.

## 210D - set_rev

Sets the REV value on a chr_p.

## 210E - set_rev2

Sets the REV2 value on a chr_p.

## 210F

## 2110

## 2111 - create_hitbox_with_offset

Similar to [2104 - create_hitbox](#2104---create_hitbox), but instead of putting the hitbox at (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) of the bone, it allows you to specify a point in relation to the bone.

## 2112 - set_timer_decrement

Sets the amount to decrement `sync_timer` per frame. Second operand of `SEQ_RegCMD2` is the amount to decrement.
If the second operand is 0, defaults to 0x100. Also seems to be overridden with other values in some circumstances.

In GNT4, the second operand is always 0 for all characters. Therefore, the timer decrement will always default to 0x100.

## 2113

## 2114

## 2115

## 2116

## 2117

## 2118

## 2119

## 211A

## 211B - chakra_meter_add

## 211C

## 211D

Adds an unknown flag to the specified bone id (the third byte of the opcode).

Only seems to be used in each character's 5B, except for Akamaru, Kimimaro, and OTK Naruto. Anko is the only character to also use this in another location, namely her action for action id 0x194.

For example: `211D0C26` adds it to the bone `0x0C`.

## 211E

Removes an unknown flag to the specified bone id (the third byte of the opcode).

Only seems to be used in each character's 5B, except for Akamaru, Kimimaro, and OTK Naruto. Anko is the only character to also use this in another location, namely her action for action id 0x194.

For example: `211D0C26` adds it to the bone `0x0C`.
