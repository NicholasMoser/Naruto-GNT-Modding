# Opcode Group 2A

## op\_2A00 (screen\_effect)
Used to create full screen effects like flashes on kunai slashes
<details>
  Get operands by calling SEQ_RegCMD2
  The lower two bytes of the first word after the SEQ_RegCMD2 operands have been decoded decide which effect is created

  ### Example
    
  `2A003F00 00000000 26000000 000D0009 00000001 00000033 00000000 00000001 40000000 00000002`
    
  Above creates screen effect type 9 on hit

## op\_2A01 (character\_effect)
Used to create effects located on a character
  
Get operands by calling SEQ_RegCMD2, all versions seem to call with chr_p and seq_p_sp->field_0x24
The higher two bytes of the first word after the SEQ_RegCMD2 operands have been decoded decide which type of effect is created, the lower 2 should be either 0 or 1, 0 need different parameters, as of now all assumptions are for value 1
<details>    
Loads data stored in the character's 0000.seq
    
Third last word seems to always be 0
    
Second to last word is number of frames before the effect shows up
    
Last word is number of frames the effect is active

<summary>Example</summary>
    
`2A012621 00060001 00031340 00000000 00000006 0000000A`
    
Above creates character effect type 6 with data stored at offset 0x31340 in the seq file, it starts showing 6 frames after the function is called, and stays for 10 frames.
