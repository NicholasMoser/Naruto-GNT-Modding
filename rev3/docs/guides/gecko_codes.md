## PAL

### 60 FPS + Widescreen (PAL) [Nick]

This code makes Rev 3 PAL run in 60 FPS widescreen. This effectively changes the game from NTSC to PAL.
This is useful since the PAL version fixed a few bugs in the NTSC version such as the game crashing when
Kabuto does 2X on Kurenai. For more info see
